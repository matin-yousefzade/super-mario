## Introduction

This is a C++ implementation of original Super Mario video game using [SDL2 library](https://github.com/UTAP/RSDL). It was one of the projects of Advanced Programming course in my bachelor's degree at University of Tehran.

## Requirements

All of this video game is based on C++ programming language and it only needs four libraries which can be installed using the following command.

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

## Compilation

After installing the required libraries, you can easily compile and generate the execution file of video game using ``make`` command.

## Execution

After generating the execution file, you can execute the video game using ``./super_mario`` command. You can use arrow keys or ``wasd`` keys for movement of Mario. Also you can use `f` key for shooting fireballs when Mario is in white mode, `p` key for pausing the video game, and `q` key for terminating the video game.
